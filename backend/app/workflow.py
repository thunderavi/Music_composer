STYLE GUIDE FOR {request.style.upper()}:
- Idiomatic progressions: {prog_guide.get("progressions", "Use genre-appropriate chords")}
- Chord rhythm pattern: {prog_guide.get("rhythm", "4 beats per chord")}
- Recommended extensions: {prog_guide.get("extensions", "Use appropriate chord extensions")}
- Vibe/intent: {prog_guide.get("vibe", "Match the mood")}
- Example chord_events: {prog_guide.get("example", "")}

SECTION ROLE GUIDANCE:
- Intro/Outro: Simple 1-2 chord loop that establishes the mood. Low complexity.
- Verse/A-Section: Establish tonal center, build narrative tension, forward motion.
- Pre-Chorus/Build: Increased tension, often lands on V or iv before resolution.
- Chorus/Hook/Drop: Maximum energy and resolution. Strong tonic (I) arrival.
- Bridge/Break/Solo: Maximum harmonic contrast. Consider parallel minor, borrowed chords.

THEORY RULES:
1. ALL chords must be diatonic to {request.key} or tastefully borrowed (e.g., bVII, bVI, iv in major).
2. chord_events duration_beats for each section MUST sum to exactly: bars × {beats_per_bar}.
3. Use only parseable chord symbols: C, Am, G7, Fmaj7, Dm9, Esus4, A5, Bb, etc.
4. The flat "chords" array must list chord names in the same order as chord_events.
5. Avoid clichéd default progressions unless they genuinely suit the style.
6. Add rhythmic variety — mix 4-beat and 2-beat chords where appropriate to the style.
7. the lyrics should be properly define with the chord supposedly an example:     Em       C  
Dehleez pe mere dil ki jo rakhe hain tune qadam  
G        D        Em       C

Input musical draft:

Tier guidelines for {tier.upper()}:

{"- BALANCED: Retain tasteful improvised extensions (like maj7, add9, sus4). Maintain structural cohesion while keeping interesting melodic hooks." if tier == "balanced" else ""}
{"- WILD: Extreme creativity. Add unexpected modal changes, experimental chords, or chromatic passing melody notes. Make lyrics highly abstract and experimental." if tier == "wild" else ""}

Output the final song draft using this schema exactly:
{{
  "title": string,
  "style": "{request.style}",
  "mood": "{request.mood}",
  "key": "{request.key}",
  "tempo_bpm": {request.tempo_bpm},
  "time_signature": "{request.time_signature}",

  ],
  "lyrics": [string],
  "style_notes": [string],
  "originality_notes": [string],
  "disclaimer": "Generated music may resemble existing works. Review and clear rights before commercial use."
}}

HOW TO GENERATE lyric_chord_lines:
- For each lyric line, place [ChordName] inline at the word where that chord begins.
- Use the SAME chords from chord_events — do not invent new ones.
- Each chord from chord_events should appear once per lyric line (roughly proportional to its duration).
- Format: "[Am]Zindagi chalti [G]jaaye, [F]gham bhi [C]hote hain saath"
- If a section has 4 chords and 2 lyric lines, distribute ~2 chords per line.
- lyric_chord_lines must have the SAME number of entries as lyric_lines.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown fences, no commentary, no extra text.
- chord_events durations must sum to bars × beats_per_bar for each section.
- chord_events and chords must stay in sync (same chords, same order).
- melody: max 12 notes per section. lyric_lines and lyric_chord_lines: max 6 per section.
- lyrics: max 16 total. style_notes + originality_notes: max 6 each.
